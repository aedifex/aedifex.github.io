I recieved a battlefield promotion when my manager, mentor, and friend recently decided to pursue a great opportunity with another start up. It gave me pause to reflect on my values as a leader.

1. Personal / professional growth
2. Win as a team, lose as a team
3. Balancing technical and personal commitments

I've had a lot of support. I have a great team. We're in a great spot.

I also am very cogniscant of what I'm signing up for.
