I've wanted to pursue an education at UC Berkeley for years. This was the perfect program. Thankfully the program is designed for working professionals. It is a lot, but well worth it.

I would highly recommend this program to someone seriously pursuing a career in cybersecurity. If all roads lead to Rome, there are many ways to obtain a rewarding career in tech, from both traditional (college) non-traditional (military, self taught, etc) paths. This is but one avenue. The coursework is demanding. You'll have the priviledge of exposure to world class professors. Most importantly, is your cohort of fellow MICS students. Many of your fellow classmates are future CISOs of America.
