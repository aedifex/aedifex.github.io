subtitle: I'm trying to change the world. Seriously.

<p>Ave mundus (Latin for hello, world!) — and thanks for stopping by. My name is Christopher Black. I'm a technology professional, writer, and student of systems, history, and philosophy. I was born and raised in San Francisco — still one of the most beautiful cities on earth — and I'm currently a senior solutions engineer at Harness.</p>

<p>Harness builds a modern software delivery platform trusted by some of the most demanding engineering teams in the world. My work focuses on CI/CD, infrastructure as code, and security automation — helping organizations ship faster while improving visibility and control across their environments.</p>

<p>Previously, I worked at Lacework, where I partnered with security teams to implement comprehensive DevSecOps programs, support compliance efforts in tightly regulated environments, and help bring visibility and control to cloud infrastructure operating at scale. I’ve also worked across several early-stage startups including CircleCI. You could say I've spent a lot of time in the engine room. I've been incredibly fortunate to have such a great career working with talented individuals and truly innovative companies.</p>

<p>Currently, I am finishing my master's degree in cybersecurity at UC Berkeley. It’s a rigorous program — technical, demanding, and filled with classmates who will likely be the next generation of CISOs. I have a wide range of interests and intellectual pursuits, from ancient history to software and technology; from political theory and the writings of Rousseau to Nas and the masterpiece that is <em>Illmatic</em>.</p>

<p>My present role as a solutions engineer sits at the intersection of engineering and sales. It’s a demanding but deeply rewarding client-facing role that offers the chance to work with brilliant people while solving complex technical problems. Working in the security space is uniquely challenging because I’m constantly exposed to evolving architectures, shifting threat models, and a wide range of technologies — from secure software development to policy enforcement in distributed systems. From code to cloud, we cover the full spectrum of modern software delivery and security.</p>

<p>Outside of work and school, I’m passionate about technology’s impact on society and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I spend a fair amount of my free time exploring emerging tech, contributing to open-source projects, and staying involved in the broader engineering community. I believe that sharing knowledge and collaborating with others are key to innovation and progress.</p>

<p>I volunteer extensively with Larkin Street Youth Services, teaching homeless and at-risk youth computer science, programming, and career readiness. It’s easily the most rewarding thing I do. Larkin Street supported me during one of the darkest chapters of my life, and volunteering is my way of paying it forward.</p>

<p>Toastmasters is another big part of my life. Public speaking is a powerful skill that transcends profession or background. I’ve been a proud member of Golden Gate Toastmasters for several years now, and it’s had a huge impact on my ability to communicate with confidence and clarity. If you’ve never been to a meeting, I highly recommend checking one out.</p>

<p>This site is where I write about my passions — software, security, infrastructure, DevOps — along with occasional reflections on the ancient world, public speaking, and the path I’ve taken as an SE navigating the evolving world of tech. I’ll also share updates on the work I do with Larkin Street, and how you can get involved.</p>

<p>If you love technology, history, and philosophy… if you don’t take yourself too seriously… if you prefer good hip-hop over hipster coffee — you’ve found the right corner of the internet. Welcome.</p>
